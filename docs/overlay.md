# Overlay Sprite

Assume we have an identical spritesheet, animations, everything.

We just want to create a new Sprite that is tied to the current state.

Create Overlay component.
Pass STATES.
Pass sprite.
Give new url.

Overlay needs to update state when sprite updates, but it also needs to be able to update the url reactively.
